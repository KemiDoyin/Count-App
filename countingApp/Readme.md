## Overview

This is an application that shows the total number of counts you make. You can start by clicking on the *COUNT* button and this will automatically increase the number of counts by one. 
The New Entries shows the current counts you make and the Previous Entries shows the counts you had before the current whenever you *STOP*.
You can start the counts afresh by selecting the *RESET* button
